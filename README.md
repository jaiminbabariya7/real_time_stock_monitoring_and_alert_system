# Stock Monitoring System Architecture

## Overview

The stock monitoring system is designed to provide users with real-time updates on stock prices and facilitate informed investment decisions. It consists of several components leveraging Google Cloud services and third-party APIs.

## Components

1. **User Interface (UI)**
   - A web interface built with Python using Flask or Django frameworks. Users can register, log in, select stocks, and set alert thresholds.

2. **Stock API**
   - Integration with a third-party API for fetching real-time stock prices.

3. **Google Cloud Functions**
   - Serverless functions for efficient processing and scalability.
     - **Fetch Prices Function**: Retrieves stock prices and publishes to Google Cloud Pub/Sub.
     - **Process and Store Function**: Processes data, stores in Google Firestore, and checks threshold conditions.
     - **Alert Users Function**: Sends notifications to users based on predefined thresholds.

4. **Google Cloud Pub/Sub**
   - A messaging service that decouples the fetching and processing of stock data, ensuring scalability and flexibility.

5. **Google Firestore**
   - A NoSQL database for storing user preferences, stock data for historical analysis, and threshold settings.

6. **Notification Service**
   - Sends alerts to users via various channels such as email, SMS, or push notifications.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Set Up Google Cloud Project**
   - Create a new Google Cloud project and enable required APIs including Cloud Functions, Pub/Sub, and Firestore.

2. **Develop User Interface**
   - Set up a dynamic web project using Flask or Django, integrating user authentication, stock selection, and alert threshold settings.

3. **Fetch Prices Function**
   - Implement a Cloud Function to periodically fetch stock prices from the third-party API and publish them to Pub/Sub.

4. **Process and Store Function**
   - Develop a Cloud Function to process incoming stock data, store it in Firestore, and evaluate against user-defined alert thresholds.

5. **Alert Users Function**
   - Create a Cloud Function responsible for sending notifications to users via the notification service based on threshold conditions.

6. **Testing and Deployment**
   - Thoroughly test the system locally, including unit tests for individual functions, before deploying to the Google Cloud platform. Utilize continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines for automated testing and deployment.

7. **Monitoring and Maintenance**
   - Set up monitoring and logging using Google Cloud Monitoring and Logging services to track system performance and troubleshoot issues. Implement regular maintenance tasks including updates to dependencies and security patches.

## Conclusion

The stock monitoring system offers a robust and scalable solution for real-time stock monitoring, empowering users to make well-informed investment decisions. By leveraging Google Cloud services and third-party APIs, the system ensures reliability, scalability, and flexibility for future enhancements.
